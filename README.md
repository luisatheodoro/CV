## Luisa Paoliello

I am a self-taught Python Automation Tester, for the past 3 years, I've been working with clients who want to automatize their tests and improve their speed to fix bugs and release their app.
In 2011, I graduated in Advertising and Marketing after finishing university I decided I wanted to pursue the digital path and dedicated time studying SEO and Digital Marketing.
I absolutely love planning, brainstorming ideas and making it work outside the paper.
I am always driven by a need to learn and see new things, so in 2012 I moved from Brazil to London and started this crazy and awesome journey to learn how to code.
I used all the wonderful free content the internet can provide and got into the IT world as a software manual tester, then I progressed to a Python automation tester, for that I had to learn Python quickly.
I love working with software automation but I also love new challenges.
I decided to become a full stack Web Developer, but this time I didn't want to do it completely alone, I decided to join this amazing code bootcamp called "Makers Academy", a three month intensive Full Stack course.


## Skills

#### Self Taught
During university I was always going after extra knowledge that I thought would be important for my goals, I started learning SEO and Digital Marketing because I wanted to work with digital content and my course didn't
have any class related to it.
When I decided I wanted to work with IT, I researched and traced a path to educate myself. Whatever goal I had I was always finding contents and courses online, and books that could provide me with the knowledge I needed.
Working as an Automation Tester I always had to learn multiple new things so I could deliver a good job, as things were evolving and client needs were changing I needed to learn new technologies and new languages.
 
#### Fast Learner
Working for Testlio, every time they changed project structure for something I didn't have any experience with I had to learn fast to keep up with the rest of the team.
The same at university, I had to learn fast new tools like editing videos, images and audio to complete complexed projects like filming a video clip, editing radio and print ads.
 
#### Working well under pressure
 At university we had to work on real advertising and marketing projects, I was the team leader and had to work with strict deadlines to finish briefs, complete the strategic planning and delivering the final product.

#### Love to work as part of a team
I was always a believer in working as part of a team. No minds think alike and everyone can contribute to solving problems. Working with advertising and marketing I had to work extremely well with my team
so we could complement each other. Working with IT is the same I am extremely sensitive with respecting others work line and always learning what I can with my teammates.
