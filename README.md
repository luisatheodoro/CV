## About Me
I am a self-taught Python Automation Tester, for the past 4 years, I've been working with clients who want to automatize their tests and improve their speed to fix bugs and release their app.
In Dec 2011, I graduated in Advertising and Marketing, after finishing university I decided I wanted to pursue the digital path and dedicated time studying SEO and Digital Marketing.
I absolutely love planning, brainstorming ideas and making it work outside the paper.
I am always driven by a need to learn and see new things, so in 2012 I moved from Brazil to London and started this crazy and awesome journey to learn how to code.
I used all the wonderful free content the internet can provide and managed to get into the IT world as a software manual tester, then I progressed to a Python automation tester, for that I had to learn Python quickly.
I loved working with testing automation but I also love new challenges.
I decided to become a full stack Web Developer, but this time I did not want to do it completely alone, I decided to join this amazing code boot camp called "Makers Academy", a three month intensive Full Stack course.

## Skills

#### Self Taught
During university I was always going after extra knowledge that I thought would be important for my goals, I started learning SEO and Digital Marketing because I wanted to work with digital content and my course didn't
have any class related to it.
When I decided I wanted to work with IT, I researched and traced a path to educate myself. Whatever goal I had I was always finding contents and courses online, and books that could provide me with the knowledge I needed.
Working as an Automation Tester I always had to learn multiple new things so I could deliver a good job, as things were evolving and client needs were changing I needed to learn new technologies and new languages.
 
#### Fast Learner
Working for Testlio, every time they changed project structure for something I didn't have any experience with I had to learn fast to keep up with the rest of the team.
The same at university, I had to learn fast new tools like editing videos, images and audio to complete complexed projects like filming a video clip, editing radio and print ads.
During Makers Academy every week we had to go through new concepts and sometimes new technologies, I had to be able to learn fast to complete tasks and weekend projects.
 
#### Working well under pressure
 At university we had to work on real advertising and marketing projects, I was the team leader and had to work with strict deadlines to finish briefs, complete the strategic planning and delivering the final product.
 During my final project in Makers Academy we had two weeks to learn ReactJS and Rails API and deliver a minimum viable product to showcase. 
 I had to really step up my game and was very satisfied with our final result.

#### Love to work as part of a team
I was always a believer in working as part of a team. When more people are contributing to solve a problem, you can do it faster and more efficiently. Working with advertising and marketing I had to work extremely well with my team
so we could complement each other. Working with IT is the same I am extremely sensitive with respecting others work and always learning what I can with my teammates.

*Silver service waitress(London)*

86 St James Ltd is the Catering arm of the Grand Lodge of Mark Master Masons and its mission is to provide refreshments to all Masonic units visiting Mark Masons' Hall.
I was a zero hour contract and had to learn how to silver service, which I did for a year.
It was a demanding job, physically and mentally as we had to attend hundreds of people at the same time in a short time frame. I've learned a lot about:

- Being organized, as we had to clean and prepare the kitchen and dining rooms for service.
- Teamwork, working as a silver service waitress you need to coordinate with the others to deliver a good service. We also had to work as a team for service preparation.
- Working under pressure, we usually had hundreds of Masons dinning every night and they all dinned at the same time in different rooms, we had to be quick because usually when we've finished serving a room we would have to go straight to another.

*Junior Strategic Planner(Brazil)*

I have a profound love for history and different cultures and because of that I love travelling and learning about the culture and 
history of every place I visit. I created a blog, in portuguese, to document about my travels and help others.
