## Luisa Paoliello

I am a self-taught Python Automation Tester, for the past 3 years, I've been working with clients who want to automatize their tests and improve their speed to fix bugs and release their app.
In 2011, I graduated in Advertising and Marketing after finishing university I decided I wanted to pursue the digital path and dedicated time studying SEO and Digital Marketing.
I absolutely love planning, brainstorming ideas and making it work outside the paper.
I am always driven by a need to learn and see new things, so in 2012 I moved from Brazil to London and started this crazy and awesome journey to learn how to code.
I used all the wonderful free content the internet can provide and got into the IT world as a software manual tester, then I progressed to a Python automation tester, for that I had to learn Python quickly.
I love working with software automation but I also love new challenges.
I decided to become a full stack Web Developer, but this time I didn't want to do it completely alone, I decided to join this amazing code bootcamp called "Makers Academy", a three month intensive Full Stack course.
